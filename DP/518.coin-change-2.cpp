 * Testcase Example:  '5\n[1,2,5]'
 *
 * You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different
 * denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
 *
 * Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount
 * of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.
 *
 * You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
 *
 * The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
 * 5=5
 * 5=2+2+1
 * 5=2+1+1+1
 * 5=1+1+1+1+1
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= coins.length <= 300
 * 1 <= coins[i] <= 5000
 * All the values of coins are unique.
 * 0 <= amount <= 5000
 *
